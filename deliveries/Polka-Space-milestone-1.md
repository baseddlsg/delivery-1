**Context** (optional)
We have successfully completed Milestone 1 of the Polka-Space NFT portfolio integration, delivering a production-ready platform that enables university students to mint their 3D creative work as NFTs on the Polkadot ecosystem. The implementation includes full PAPI migration, ink! smart contracts on AssetHub, and comprehensive VR integration.

### User Validation
- **University Adoption**: 800+ students across 4 universities actively using the platform
- **Target Exceeded**: Surpassed initial goal of 50+ UAL students for pilot testing
- **Non-Crypto Native Users**: Successfully onboarding 2D/3D artists who want to monetize their work without crypto knowledge

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing suite with unit tests, integration tests, and e2e workflows
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback systems
- **Performance**: Optimized with caching, lazy loading, and performance monitoring
